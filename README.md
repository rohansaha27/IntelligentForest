# IntelligentForest
AI tool to predict forest fires! 

# Probelem Statement: 
Climate change has inexorably increased the chances of more damaging and intense fires across the globe. While we all need to address global warming, we need to be better prepared to control these wildfires using Artificial Intelligence.

# Background: 
Types of forest fires: 
1. Crown Fires - Burns trees up their entire length to the top
2. Surface Fires - Only burn dried leaves, grasses etc.
3. Ground Fires - Sometimes called underground or subsurface fires.

Causes of forest fires: 
1. Natural causes e.g. lightning
2. Man-made causes e.g., cigarette, electric spark
3. Climatic conditions e.g hotter and drier weather

# Hypothesis: 
Use climatic conditions of a region and AI to predict the forest fire risk for the region. In this research we would use the features below for forest fire prediction
1. Minimal Temperature of the day
2. Maximum Temperature of the day
3. Rainfall recorded for the day
4. Solar radiation over the day
5. Evaporation during the day

# Using the climatic conditions of a region we would predict the forest fire with the categorization below:
1. No Risk
2. Low Risk
3. Medium Risk
4. High Risk

# In our research we would try predicting the Forest fires using below Machine learning techniques
